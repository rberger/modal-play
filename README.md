Experiments around modal overlays in re-frame based on
[benhowell/re-frame-modal](https://github.com/benhowell/re-frame-modal)

> Basic re-frame recipe for creating modal/dialog/overlay panels. This
> implementation is pure re-frame and css, free from jQuery and DOM manipulation
> and can be used as a drop-in replacement for Bootstrap modals.

You can use Bootstrap CSS to style the modal overlays. This repo shows using
bootstrap for the overlay that is displayed (`modal-play.modal/hello-bootstrap`)

## Usage

1. Clone repo to your local filesystem and `cd` into the repo
2. `npm install` (only need to do first time)
3. `shadow-cljs watch app`
4. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080/
